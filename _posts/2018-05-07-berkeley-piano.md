## Overview

If you visit UC Berkeley you may encounter a brightly painted piano on Sproul Plaza, the main thoroughfare on the south side of campus. If you're lucky you might hear some beautiful music from the piano. If you're unlucky the piano may have already been removed, demolished, vandalized, or have otherwise met some unsavory end by the time you have read this. Either way, this post is to recount how the piano ended up there in the first place.

The Berkeley Public Piano is my brainchild and was the result of much work by me and a close group of friends. Some of us can play the piano marvelously and some of us can barely hum on pitch (I am part of the latter category). Nevertheless, we were all united in the goal of bringing the beauty and joy of music to an otherwise dreary and sterile campus. We were tired of students walking with their headphones in and eyes on the ground, rushing to their next class or to the library to finish their homework. We wanted people to slow down and appreciate life. We wanted to see if we could unite people through music.

Another aspect of this project is the social experiment. I believe in humanity and I believe that people respect beauty. So many times I heard something to the effect of: "The piano won't last a week. People will steal it and vandalize it. Homeless people will trash it." In a sense, the piano was my attempt to prove this view wrong. 

## Inspiration

The summer of 2017 I visited Denver. There, on the 16th street mall I found brightly colored pianos on every block, free to use by anyone who wanted to. I was slightly miffed that Berkeley did not have one. An idea had been planted.

## Feedback

Arriving at Berkeley after the summer, I told anybody who would listen about a potential public piano. The typical response went something like this:

- Wow that sounds really cool
- Wait, how would you get a piano?
- Wait, who would pay for it?
- Wait, how would you transport it?
- Wait, wouldn't it be vandalized?
- Wait, wouldn't it be stolen?
- Wait, won't the administration take it away?
- Wait, what if it rains?

Evidently, there were many hurdles to overcome.

## Acquiring a Piano

As everybody knows, the first step in putting a public piano on Sproul is to obtain a piano. And as it turns out, there are many free pianos on <a href="https://sfbay.craigslist.org/search/eby/sss?sort=rel&query=free+piano" target="_blank">Craigslist</a> (I'd say maybe 4-5 in East Bay every week). This is because there are many people who want to be rid of their piano but don't want to pay to get it moved out. Thus, they offer the piano for free under the condition that you provide transportation. I set up alerts for free pianos in east bay and waited for the free pianos to roll in.

I ended up visiting two houses with pianos. One on Albany Hill and one in the Berkeley Hills. Both pianos were utterly massive and had to be carried down a narrow flight of stairs. I gave up on both.

Finally, I received an alert about a piano in Oakland. It was perfect: on wheels, easily accessible, short drive away. I decided to try to get this one. At this point in time I was really the only person working on this project and I'm pretty sure everybody assumed I was delusional. Nevertheless, I convinced my roommate, Max, to come help me pick it up. I rented a U-Haul (costed about $50) and Max and I hauled the piano back to Berkeley. 

As it turned out, the piano was perfect except for one thing: it was broken beyond repair. Most of the notes worked but they were all very out of tune. More than a few notes simply didn't play. (**Spoiler:** This piano is not the piano currently on Sproul).

## Languishing

The piano sat in our apartment for about 5 months. I blame procrastination and too much school work and general laziness. 

## Inspiration

With about a month left of school, I was suddenly struck by the inspiration that is deadlines. Faced with the prospect of getting kicked out of my apartment and having an entire piano to deal with I decided to finally put the piano on Sproul. To the best of my ability I repaired the broken keys and gathered a group of friends. At around 2 am we rolled the piano through Southside and on to Sproul plaza.

## Success and Disaster

The piano caused quite a stir. For three or four days it stood on Sproul plaza with people marveling at it's mysterious appearance. Scenes like this were common:

<center> Three seperate groups of strangers, swept out of the rat-race of life to enjoy a little music and each other's company</center><br>

But alas, all good things must come to and end. As abruptly as the piano had appeared, it dissapeared. Nobody knew where it was. The theory that many had was that people had stolen the piano. I vehmently disagree. 

My theory is that people had simply assumed the piano was up for grabs. There was no signage to indicate that the piano was meant to be shared, nor was it entirely obvious what the function of a dilapidated piano was on Sproul Plaza. I attribute this seemingly terrible show of the dark side of human nature to a simple misunderstanding. And to prove my point, I decided to put another piano on Sproul.

## A Seoncd Chance

In the wake of the publicity that the original piano had received, I had no trouble finding a group of people willing to sell their piano to put on Sproul. Phoebe, a Cal student, was selling one for $150 and even offered to paint it with her art friends (they did a fantastic job if I may say so myself).

In addition to a new piano with a paint job, I endeavored to make it completely obvious that the piano was to be for the public. To that effect I bought some chains and a lock to tie the piano down, and also made a sign for the piano. In addition this second piano had no wheels, making it ludicrously difficult to move. 

Once again, at around 1 am a group of friends and I lugged the piano (on a rolling platform) on to sproul.

For couple weeks there was hardly a moment that the piano was not being played. This time, the piano stayed.
